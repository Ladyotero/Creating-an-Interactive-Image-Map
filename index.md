### Creating an Interactive Image Map

## Objective

- Create an HTML webpage featuring an interactive image map. This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of the <map> and <area> tags and their application in creating clickable regions within an image.

# Instructions

- This assignment involves developing an HTML-only webpage that displays an image map with multiple clickable areas. Each area will link to a related image or webpage. The project should be structured and deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Part 1: Creating the Webpage

 -Create a New Repository:

 -On GitHub, create a new repository named Interactive-Image-Map.
 -Initialize this repository with a README.md file.
 -Clone your new repository to your local machine.

# Develop the Webpage

 -Choose an image from Unsplash that has multiple distinct items or areas

- Create an index.html file in your repository

 1. The webpage should include:
A heading (<h1>) describing the image map.
The chosen image from Unsplash.
An image map (<map> tag) with clickable areas (<area> tags).
Each clickable area should link to a related image or webpage. This can be a direct link to another image or a separate HTML page featuring the image.
Comments in the code explaining the map and area setup.

## Part 2: Testing and Validation
Test the Image Map:
Ensure that each clickable area correctly redirects to the intended link.
Test the functionality in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

## Part 3: Deployment and Submission
Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages:

In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
Select the branch you want to deploy (usually main).
Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.
Submit Your Work:

Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
